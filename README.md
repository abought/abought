### About
I am a Research Software Engineer and full-stack web developer. I design and implement solutions to help teams understand complex datasets and collaborate across many fields of study. My collaborators have included physical scientists, biologists, and automotive engineers, among many others!

### A few previous projects
I have been fortunate to work on a number of small teams with outsized impact:

* [my.locuszoom.org](https://my.locuszoom.org): The field standard for visualizations to show genetic research findings in context. A web based service that asynchronougly ingests user-provided data, applies an annotation pipeline, and enables sharing of harmonized published datasets to the global community. Permissively licensed: use the entire site, or just the modular components and customize to your needs.
* [TOPMed Imputation Server](https://imputation.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#!): Provides high-quality "big data" scientific workflows in a protected AWS compute environment. By providing genotype imputation, we can enable drastically more cost effective research and lower the barriers to entry.
* Open Science Framework / [OSF Preprints](https://osf.io/preprints/): Upload articles and datasets to share and get a DOI. Data sharing and collaboration features.
* Genes for Good, MIT Lookit, and others: Recruit diverse audiences nationwide to help contribute to better, more representative research. Surveys, videos, and other capabilities


### Ask me about
* Bringing software engineering best practices into the R&D space (a few [example presentations](https://github.com/abought/slides/tree/gh-pages/csg))
* Leveraging new technologies to foster better insights. I like learning something new!
* Combining metrics and user insights to deliver the right features at the right time

### Things I enjoy
* Working with great collaborators and learning something new
* Choosing the right technologies to deliver impactful solutions
* Making things a little better every day: software testing, usability, and driving continuous improvement across teams
